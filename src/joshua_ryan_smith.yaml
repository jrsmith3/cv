      - 'I am a seasoned leader of teams that build and maintain
        enterprise-scale data engineering and sophisticated
        computational applications. I drive results by investing in
        the members of my team and by establishing systems that
        facilitate excellence of my teams. My experience spans
        diverse industries such as financial services, advanced
        manufacturing, national defense, and academia.'

          - 'Since August 2023 I have managed the two teams of the
            OnePassport application which provides access to all
            enterprise RDS and DynamoDB instances for the SCAN and
            Metabot applications.

            From May of 2022 to August of 2023 I managed six teams
            across four applications: Metabot (dataset inventory),
            Datastore Inventory, Data Retention, and Data Governance
            Suite.

            From November 2020 to May of 2022 I managed two teams for
            the processor and orchestration components of the SCAN
            application. SCAN searches for highly sensitive human
            data such as SSN, credit card number, etc. in S3. In 2021
            my teams successfully processed more than 100 PB of data
            at a rate averaging 500 TB/day to satisfy a regulatory
            requirement.

            From March 2019 to November 2020 I was the technical lead
            for the Loss Forecasting solution used by the Credit Risk
            Management team for Card.'

            betavoltaic and betaphotovoltaic devices. Our team
            demonstrated a working GaN based betavoltaic device -- I
            specified the structure, verified the devices using
            electron beam induced current scanning tunneling
            microscopy, and guided the devices through the various
            fabrication and characterization steps. For the
            betaphotovoltaic part of the project, I specified the
            AlGaN photovoltaic structure and developed a process of
            electrophoretic deposition to apply phosphor to the
            photovoltaic devices post-fabrication.

            In addition to the radioisotope batteries, I developed a
            model of electron transport through a thermoelectron
            energy conversion device featuring a negative electron
            affinity anode. The software I wrote for this project is
