Summary
=======
I am a seasoned leader of teams that build and maintain
enterprise-scale data engineering and sophisticated computational
applications. I drive results by investing in the members of my team
and by establishing systems that facilitate excellence of my teams.
My experience spans diverse industries such as financial services,
advanced manufacturing, national defense, and academia.


Experience
==========

**Capital One** - Senior Data Engineering Manager (March 2019 -
Present).

My work at Capital One has mainly been leading multiple teams across
the senstive data detection and data inventory space. Highlights
include SCAN, in which our application processed >100 petabytes of
all of Capital One's production S3 data to identify highly sensitive
human data. Metabot, in which our application routinely processes S3
inventory data to identify millions of datasets. OnePassport, which
my teams built from scratch to facilitate the export of all of
Capital One's production RDS and DynamoDB resources (petabytes of
data across thousands of instances) to be processed by SCAN and
Metabot


**Xometry** - Director of Compultational Geometry (February 2016 -
March 2019).

Xometry is a marketplace that matches customers with manufacturers
(CNC, 3D printing, injection moulding, and more) using AI. I led the
team that developed the computational geometry application used as
inputs to the ML model that determined prices. I architected the
computational geometry application, and I developed the Docker-based
deployment process of the application.


**US Army Research Laboratory** - ORAU Senior Researcher, Sensors and
Electron Devices Directorate (August 2011 - February 2016).

At ARL I investigated radioisotope batteries, namely betavoltaic and
betaphotovoltaic devices. Our team demonstrated a working GaN based
betavoltaic device -- I specified the structure, verified the devices
using electron beam induced current scanning tunneling microscopy,
and guided the devices through the various fabrication and
characterization steps.


**Carnegie Mellon University** - Postdoctoral Researcher, Prof. Robert
Davis (June 2008 - July 2011).

I led the effort to develop a silicon nanolithography process using a
scanning tunneling microscope tip as a stylus. I built the lab from
scratch and managed three graduate students.
