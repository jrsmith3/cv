Summary
=======

I have expertise in leading technical teams which build sophisticated
computational applications. Prior to my current position, I worked in
fundamental scientific research investigating the physics of energy
conversion devices, nanolithography, and wide-bandgap semiconductor
power devices.


Experience
==========

**Xometry** - Director of Data Engineering (Sept 2018 - Present).

The Data Engineering team at Xometry is responsible for maintaining
production quality code which handles or manipulates data. Our first
and current project is rearchitect Xometry's quoting flow such that
the web client and geometry/pricing backend communication is
asynchronous. In this role I manage two senior software engineers.


**Xometry** - Director of Computational Geometry (June 2018 - 
Sept 2018).

I lead the team that develops and implements the computational 
geometry algorithms to identify geometric features that drive the 
price of the parts. My team of 5 reports included PhD and MSc level 
members with degrees in Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, and 
Chemical Engineering with a focus in Computational Fluid Dynamics.

In addition to managing the team, I architected the computational 
geometry application, and I developed the Docker-based deployment 
process of the application. Our app is a model of unit test coverage 
within the company. The geometry application is a key piece of the 
technology stack at the center of Xometry's value proposition.


**Xometry** - Senior Computational Scientist (February 2016 - 
June 2018).

Xometry is a manufacturing on demand startup -- our customers upload
their CAD models, and our software analyzes the geometry and issues an
instant quote for manufacture. Xometry quotes a variety of
manufacturing processes including 3D printing, CNC machining, sheet
metal, and a number of others.  I lead the team that develops and
implements the computational geometry algorithms to identify geometric
features that drive the price of the parts. My team of 5 reports
includes PhD and MSc level members with degrees in Computer Science,
Mechanical Engineering, and Chemical Engineering with a focus in
Computational Fluid Dynamics.

In addition to managing the team, I architected the computational
geometry application, and I developed the Docker-based deployment
process of the application. Our app is a model of unit test coverage
within the company. The geometry application is a key piece of the
technology stack at the center of Xometry's value proposition.


**US Army Research Laboratory** - ORAU Senior Researcher, Sensors and
Electron Devices Directorate (August 2011 - February 2016).

At ARL I have investigated radioisotope batteries, namely betavoltaic
and betaphotovoltaic devices. Our team demonstrated a working GaN based
betavoltaic device -- I specified the structure, verified the devices
using electron beam induced current scanning tunneling microscopy, and
guided the devices through the various fabrication and characterization
steps. For the betaphotovoltaic part of the project, I specified the
AlGaN photovoltaic structure and developed a process of electrophoretic
deposition to apply phosphor to the photovoltaic devices
post-fabrication.

In addition to the radioisotope batteries, I developed a model of
electron transport through a thermoelectron energy conversion device
featuring a negative electron affinity anode. The software I wrote for
this project is used by university research groups and a startup
company. 
This work was `recognized by ARL <http://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=2462>`_ as well as the `official homepage of the US Army <http://www.army.mil/article/123473/Visiting_Army_scientist_makes_discoveries_in_emerging_technology/>`_.

**Carnegie Mellon University** - Postdoctoral Researcher, Prof. Robert
Davis (June 2008 - July 2011).

At CMU I was the lead postdoc on a project to develop a nanolithography
technique using a scanning tunneling microscope tip as a stylus. During
this time I built the `TFAN nanolithography/surface science
laboratory <https://www.flickr.com/groups/tfan/>`_ from scratch. This
lab featured an ultrahigh vacuum surface analysis system including
in-situ sample preparation, scanning probe microscopy, x-ray
photoemission spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and low-energy
electron diffraction. I managed three graduate students and we developed
processes to clean and hydrogen passivate Si (100), write features in
the hydrogen passivation with the scanning probe tip, and adsorb
disilane to the features.

**NC State University** - Graduate Research Assistant, Profs. Robert J.
Nemanich and Griff L. Bilbro (August 2002 - August 2007).

At NCSU I investigated thermionic energy conversion devices based on
diamond electrodes. I developed a comprehensive model of electron
transport through the device which could account for emission from a
diamond cathode featuring negative electron affinity. I implemented the
model initially in MATLAB and later refactored in python. I also
investigated negative electron affinity amorphous carbon films for the
`Interstellar Boundary Explorer
(IBEX) <http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ibex/index.html>`_ mission in
collaboration with Lockheed Martin. I developed a hydrogen passivation
process for the amorphous carbon films and characterized the negative
electron affinity with ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy. I applied
this process to amorphous carbon facets which were used as part of the
IBEX-Lo detector. The IBEX space probe was launched October 19, 2008.

Skills and capabilities
=======================

My specialty is leading technical teams building sophisticated
computational applications that are key to an organization's success.
I have extensive experience with Python, numpy, and scipy. I have
architected distributed, asynchronous applications based on the celery
asynchronous task queue. I drove adoption of deployment via Docker in
my current organization, and I wrote the original Dockerfile for my
team's microservice.

I also have extensive experience with experimental surface
science, ultrahigh vacuum equipment, and laboratory operations.
